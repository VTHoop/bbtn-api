# bbtn-api

This project is intended to be a "knock-off" of the Reddit game, Baseball by the Numbers.

It is in its very infant stages and only allows a Game to be created with subsequent "At-Bats" to play the game.

Further enhancements could include:

[ ] Player Creation
[ ] Team Roster Creation
[ ] Team Standings
[ ] Event Log of all At-Bats to allow game replays and stat construction
[ ] Tracking actual players (not true/false) around bases for run-scoring statistics
